### Overview
- Hard spoiler alert do not read if you dont't want to be spoiled

Hello everyone welcome to my solution. To be honest this is one of the first projects I wanted to do about 2 months ago when I first started coding. I tried watching videos and used chatgpt maybe in the wrong ways and didn't end up learning from it unfortunately lol. Recently I came across the accordion challenge again after complete a few javascript projects on my tech course that I am proudly pursuing. Let me tell you learning the raw way with just a bit of reading material and common sense you can really rack your brain and feel very accomplished at the end of it ESPECIALLY the minor things.Anyways pretty straightfoward solution as basic as counting to A-Z.. 

### The challenge

- The easiest part of the challenge was probably the javascript. I use a stone age beginner approach doing steps as basic as possible. POV looks like general pulling of elements into my JS file and thinking what type of purpose each element would have.

- I used the first question as my template to first get feedback from the first plus Icon. To do this I used an event handler on the icon and set a console log inside to see if it worked. Soon as that was confirmed I changed the first paragraph display to hidden an to that effect I just had to reverse that somehow. Good old trusty if statement came in clutch with a little trick I learnt from my teacher. I'm not sure what you call it but kinda like a forced boolean variable that can manipulate an if statement to your code. Not sure what it's called to be honest. 
- I didn't manage to get the keyboard navigation going nor did I try to implement it, to be fair I didn't even read the instructions woops! I'll give it a go in the future when I commit again.

- I used a media query from chatgpt for the sake of I really didn't know how it visually looks different with the width. It seemed to automatically size down as I made the browser smaller not too sure how to see it live on a mobile device before launching off a free server?

- I was only able to fix in the generic "cursor: pointer" as a hover option, had I spent more time on this part I think I would've been a bit more happy as I usually tend to enjoy that trick. 

- The HTML was relatively easy I mean the fonts, colors and icons were practically given to me so I had no problems with either it didn't take up too much time. I would've liked to figure out some nice transitions when the button is clicked to make the accordion look smoother.

## My process
Well with projects like this I like to have a preview of the copy project on at least half of my screen. When I set that up I USUALLY use all semantic elements where needed but this time round I used mostly divs. Just challenging myself from my usual vision of things. When I lock in all the elements with id's and classes to identify them I move on to the CSS. A quick look at the style-guide and implement what I can where I can, making it as close to the preview as possible. When I do that I make sure my code is properly linked and start my javascript. I was thinking of using an onlclick attribute to call the function but I wanted to go the long way. I just translated what I wanted in plain simple english into javascript and I made a icon work 1 by 1. I would say it took about 2 hours without this long markdown.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
### What I learned

In the end I was happy that I done this without searching all too much on the internet. I have grown and this little project is a fact. Digging deeper in to the coding specifics I would probably say I am almost cofident in writing if statements. My favorite part about the project was probably figuring out how to change the two icons out when either one of them is clicked. I found out about a new property that can change the source of an image which I am really happy for. 

### Continued development

Yes very long way to go, this wasn't too challenging and not brain racking but it sure put me through the clock. According to my teacher an everyday coder projects like these should take maybe 20 minutes or less lol but what I really feel confident in and probably still need alot of guidance in is if statements. That will be my goal alongside the for loops I would rate quite hard. I'm sure I could've incorporated a loop in somewhere to refactor my code but my mind was shooting blanks. A mental remodel will be needed to broaden my thinking in different coding situations. I would rate my overall project a 5/10 just cause of the time frame I done it in.

Shouting out whoever wrote the styleguide made my brain work less and felt like I breezed through without stopping often. I really felt like I was on a roll thanks to that! I wish everyone the best on their coding walks and hope to post up some more.
